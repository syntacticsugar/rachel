 MMM T-REX I HAVE NEVER RECEIVED SUCH AN INVITATION FROM YOU AND I WILL BE PLEASED TO ATTEND
 IS THIS A PARTY OF THE LAN OR RPG VARIETY
 I CAUTION YOU
 IT CAN BE BOTH
 TODAY IS SPECIAL BECAUSE TODAY IS THE DAY I ACHIEVE 10 BILLION POINTS IN THE ARCADE VERSION OF "NIBBLER" WHICH YOU WILL NOTE IS A FULL ORDER OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER THAN WHAT HAS BEEN ACHIEVED BEFORE
 IT WILL BE
 I ASSURE YOU
 A TRULY STAGGERING ACHIEVEMENT
 MMM GREETINGS T-REX WHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON THE RISE OF CASUAL GAMING
 I WAS CLEARLY REFERRING TO SIMPLER VIDEO GAMES BUILT FOR A CASUAL AUDIENCE
 ON ONE HAND THESE GAMES APPEAL TO THOSE OUTSIDE THE STANDARD GAMING DEMOGRAPHIC AND THUS SERVE TO BROADEN THE APPEAL OF THE MEDIUM AND DISPEL SOME NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES ABOUT THOSE WHO PARTAKE OF ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT
 ON THE OTHER HAND THE CASUAL MARKET IS SO BIG THAT IT MAY ENCOURAGE FRANCHISES THAT I ENJOY TO BECOME MORE CASUAL FRIENDLY AND THIS OFTEN UNFORTUNATELY MEANS MORE SHALLOW
 AND IT'D BE EASIER FOR ME T-REX IF I COULD CONVERSE WITH SHIGERU MIYAMOTO
 HOWEVER
 HE WILL NOT BE BORN FOR 65 MILLION YEARS BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE PAST REMEMBER
 HEY
 T-REX
 IT'S THE DEVIL
 HEY
 HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED THE VIDEO GAME "COMMAND AND CONQUER: RED ALERT"
 THE MAMMOTH TANKS ARE ONE OF THE MORE POWERFUL UNITS IN THE GAME
 THEY PRESENT A FORMIDABLE FORCE TO ANY OPPONENT
 THE TESLA COILS ARE A WISE DEFENSIVE STRATEGY
 FEW CAN SURVIVE THEIR ELECTRICAL ONSLAUGHT
 GREETINGS TO YOU T-REX
 NO THE VIDEOED GAMES ARE QUITE PLENTIFUL INDEED
 I HAVE BEEN PLAYING SEVERAL MMORPGS OF LATE
 THEY ARE GAMES PLAYED ONLINE WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF STRANGERS
 THE EXPERIENCE IS UNPARALLELED
 I WOULD DISAGREE WITH THAT PARTICULAR ASSESSMENT
 T-REX YOUR COMPANION IS CLEARLY UNFAMILIAR WITH MY PROWESS IN THE REALM OF MMORPGS
 THE CHRONICLES OF MY DARK ELF CHARACTER ARE ASSUREDLY THE STUFF OF LEGEND
  GREETINGS T-REX
  I HAVE AN INQUIRY TO POSE TO YOU
  WHAT DO YOU THINK OF ADVENTURE GAMES AS A GENRE
  IT IS INTERESTING TO PONDER WHY THEIR POPULARITY HAS FALTERED WHILE THAT OF THEIR SISTER GENRE OF RPGS HAS REMAINED REMARKABLY RESOLUTE
  I ASSURE YOU THAT I HAVE NOT GONE ANYWHERE MY MOUTH WAS MERELY OCCUPIED WITH DORITO-RELATED ACTIVITIES
  I LIKE RANCH FLAVOUR
 GREETINGS T-REX WHAT IS DUCK HUNT
 I HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PLAYING A GAME IN WHICH ONE CONTROLS A ROBOT LOADED WITH FUTURISTIC WEAPONRY
 A MASTERY OF TORSIONAL TWISTING IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE VICTORY
 BUT I CONFESS I AM AS YET UNFAMILIAR WITH THE DUCK HUNT GENRE
 IS DUCK HUNT A GOOD GAME
 I SUSPECT THE GAME WAS SIMPLY NOT AVAILABLE IN MY AREA
 HA HA SERIOUSLY THOUGH WHAT IS IT LIKE
 IS IT PRETTY COOL
 MMMM HERE IT COMES
 I FIND THESE CIRCUMSTANCES TO BE QUITE HUMOROUS
 I CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DENY THESE SCURRILOUS ALLEGATIONS
 HOWEVER I DO CONFESS TO ACHIEVING UPWARDS OF 
 FIFTY POINTS
 I BRING YOU NUMEROUS GREETINGS T-REX
 AND A QUESTION I WISH TO POSE TO YOU
 I SIMPLY WISH TO ASCERTAIN YOUR OPINION ON CLASSIC GAME EMULATION
 THERE ARE OFTEN CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH A GAME'S COMPANY HAS FOLDED BUT THE GAME ITSELF REMAINS POPULAR
 IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IS IT ETHICAL TO COPY AND EMULATE THE GAME IN QUESTION
 I TOO WILL LEAVE FOR I MERELY WISH TO PLAY CLASSIC NES GAMES FOR FREE T-REX
 HOLY MOLEY
 T-REX I HAVE BEGUN TO EMPLOY NUMBERS AND SYMBOLS IN LIEU OF ACTUAL LETTERS IN ONLINE ENCOUNTERS
 AS AN EXAMPLE BACKSLASH LETTER O FORWARDSLASH
 INDICATES HOORAY
 IT SEEMS A LOT OF GAMERS USE THIS OR AT LEAST A LOT OF PORTRAYALS OF GAMERS IN THE MEDIA
 IT IS DIFFICULT TO TELL WHERE THE TRUTH LIES
 OF COURSE IT DOES I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK I'M LAME
 I ASSURE YOU
 I AM SIGNIFICANTLY AWESOME
 ACTUALLY IN HELL YOU CAN DO JUST ABOUT WHATEVER YOU WANT ONLY WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT YOU HAVE TO SING SONGS WITH ALL THE LYRICS REPLACED BY "PARTY"
 YES WELL THAT'S WHY I INVENTED THE PLACE T-REX
 I HEAR THAT.
 NO DUDE. YOU ARE TOTALLY ALONE.
 T-REX CAN YOU RATE YOUR FAMILIARITY WITH CLASSIC PEN-AND-PAPER RPGS
 ALSO KNOWN AS RPGS
 CHICKS ARE NOT AS MULTIFACETED AS A TRUE PEN-AND-PAPER ROLY PLAYING GAME T-REX
 IN WHICH ONE PERSON IS THE GAME MASTER AND TELLS EVERYONE ELSE WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM
 FOR EXAMPLE
 YOU HAVE KILLED AN ORC
 TO WHICH THE PLAYERS REPLY
 INDEED
 I INVITE YOU ALL TO PLAY RPGS WITH ME TONIGHT T-REX
 I PROMISE ONLY FLAVOURED CHIPS AND HIGH ADVENTURE
 GREETINGS T-REX HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED PLAYING A RAIL SHOOTER GAME
 IN MY OPINION THEY ARE A COMPELLING FORM OF ELECTRONIC ENTERTAINMENT
 IN SUCH GAMES THE COMPUTER CONTROLS YOUR MOVEMENT BUT YOU CONTROL THE SHOOTING OF YOUR ENEMIES AS THEY APPEAR ON SCREEN
 I BELIEVE IT TO BE A CONSTRAINED GAMING EXPERIENCE BUT IN A SENSE A MORE CINEMATIC ONE THAT RAISES THE ISSUE OF WHAT VIDEO GAMES SHOULD BE
 SOME SUGGEST THAT VIDEO GAMES SHOULD TELL STORIES LIKE FILMS OR BOOKS
 IF YOU ARE UNINTERESTED IN HEARING MY TREATISE ON COMPUTER CONTROLLED STORYTELLING I WILL FIND A MORE RECEPTIVE AUDIENCE
 BUT I CAUTION YOU
 I WAS QUITE CLOSE TO REVEALING RARE AND POWERFUL CHEAT CODES
 GREETINGS T-REX ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH SPEED RUNS
 NEGATIVE IT IS MORE ACCURATELY WHEN ONE BESTS A VIDEO GAME IN THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE TIME
 I HAVE BEEN DOING A SPEED RUN FOR THE FIRST MARIO BROTHERS FAME AND I CAN ASSURE YOU MY BEST TIME SO FAR VERGES ON INSANELY FLABBERGASTING
 INDEED IT IS AKIN TO A VIRTUOSO PIANO PERFORMANCE IN EVERY REGARD
 T-REX PLEASE INFORM YOUR COMPANION THAT DABBLING IN MACHINE-ASSISTED RUNS IS THE ULTIMATE FORM OF HERESY
 T-REX
 PLEASE TRY TO FOCUS ON THE TOPIC AT HAND
 MMM SALUTATIONS T-REX
 HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE MALE GAZE
 YES BUT
 UM
 APPARENTLY ME
 IN REALITY T-REX I WAS MERELY PLAYING SINGLE PLAYER COMPUTER JEOPARDY AND NEEDED TO KNOW WHO CAME UP WITH THE THEORY
 I ASSURE YOU
 THE TIMER HAS LONG SINCE EXPIRED
